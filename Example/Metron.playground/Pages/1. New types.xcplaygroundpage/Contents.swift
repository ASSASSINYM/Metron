 # Metron
 ## New types
 
 Hi and thanks for checking out Metron. This geometry library extends 
 the basic CoreGraphics geometric types and introduces several new types
 that will make your programming life easier.
 
 Let's start by taking a look at the new types:
 
 * Line
 * LineSegment
 * Circle
 * Triangle
 * Square
 * Polygon
 * Corner
 * Angle
 
 The following playgrounds will show the various ways to
 initialize these types and the properties that can be
 derived from them.
 
 NOTE: Run pod install in the Example folder and then open the Xcode workspace. You will need to build the project first before Metron is available in these playgrounds. Ensure that you have a Simulator-type device selected when building.
